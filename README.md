## IRC chat application

With my colleague we created a chat application using socket.io library, running on Node server and displayed with React.

## Motivation

I loved working on this project with my friend Christophe, it was very professionnal with regular commits and what it felt like a "real workday" along the making of the website. We split the tasks and everything went extraordinary. Much like, would do it again !

## Tech/framework used

Built with :

- React JS
- Node
- Bootstrap
- Socket.IO

## Features

Chat log for each channel
Usernames's list
Channels's list
Message sending to a room
Create/delete a room
Change you username

# Installation

You need to pull the repo, "npm i" in the terminal to get all node modules and you're good to launch the app with "npm run dev" (that will run node and react at the same time).
